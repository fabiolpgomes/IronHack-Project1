## Game Description

<code><img height="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XeeggKv.png"></code>

Rock, paper and scissors, also called in some regions of Brazil as **jokenp√¥**, in this game the Player will compete with the Computer. On the screen shows 3 symbol: "Rock, Paper and Scissors", the Player selects a symbol, the computer's choice is random.
Then, the program compares the symbols to decide who won, as follows:

- Stone wins from Scissors (crushing or breaking it).
- Scissors wins from Paper (cutting it).
- Paper wins from Stone (wrapping it).

The stone is symbolized by a closed fist; the scissors, by two fingers outstretched; and the paper, by the open hand. If two players make the same gesture, a tie occurs, and it is usually played again until the tie is broken. This game consists of 5 moves, whoever has the most points wins.
